                <p class="text"> <b>Free will</b> is defined as the capability to take actions 
                    independent of external forces, completely at an individual’s discretion.
                    Alternatively, free will can be summed up as the ability to do otherwise.
                    It is intuitive for people to feel like they have a choice in their behaviors,
                    but factors in the universe say otherwise. Recently, findings in <span>neuroscience </span>
                    and <span>psychology</span> have raised questions about free will, 
                    leading to the revitalization of an ancient question: 
                    <span>Do humans possess free will?</span> There are three distinctive 
                    views on free will: <span class="views">Determinism</span>,
                    <span class="views">Libertarian Free Will</span>,
                    and <span class="views">Compatibilism</span>.
                    My personal position on Free Will is Determinism. 
                    It's commonly misunderstood that determinism claims 
                    we cannot make choices. This is not the case, rather it claims that 
                    these choices are causal, like anything else in the universe. 
                    Determinism asks the question: <span id="rhetorical">Does free will really exist if 
                    we can only do what we want, but not choose what we want? </span> 
                    In this article, I will explore the arguments against free will, 
                    supported by the nature of causality and the presence of subconscious 
                    decisions that render the concept of free will refutable. 
                    Furthermore, the inability to alter our desires, which is the 
                    basis for our choices, builds upon the illusion of free will. 
                    The stated arguments will serve as the foundation for discerning 
                    whether free will exists or not.

                    Consciously made decisions are always preceded by 
                    subconscious neural activations that occur before the decision. 
                    Benjamin Libet was a pioneer in neuroscience during the 1970s. 
                    He famously ran an experiment that contested the reality of free 
                    will. In his research, he found that “the RP culminating in the 
                    execution of the movement starts in the prefrontal motor areas 
                    long before the time when the subject seems to have made the 
                    decision: participants became aware of their intention to take 
                    action about 350 milliseconds after the onset of such potential” 
                    (Lavazza 14). RP stands for readiness potential, which is when 
                    our brains send neurological signals in preparation for an action. 
                    Libet’s experiment demonstrates that our brains are not only 
                    preparing for decisions before we even think of them but are 
                    also deciding before we do. If our decisions are enacted through 
                    something we cannot control (our subconsciousness), we therefore 
                    do not have free will.

                    The universe is deterministic in nearly every aspect. 
                    In Newtonian physics, its first fundamental law is that: 
                    “...every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a 
                    straight line unless compelled to change its state by the action 
                    of an external force” (Nasa.gov 4). Free will is the capacity to 
                    act independent of an external force, for an individual to 
                    practice free will, they would need to break Newton’s first 
                    law of physics, acting with self-direction. But nothing can 
                    act with self-direction; for example, tennis ball does not 
                    decide where it bounces when it is hit. So how are humans any 
                    different? Because we are beings of consciousness? Science 
                    cannot directly prove the origins of consciousness, but with 
                    general reason, one can assume that our behaviors and beliefs 
                    stem from our brain. This can be shown with the change of behaviors 
                    in Phineas Gage, which turned the well-mannered, hard-working, 
                    religious railroad worker into an incoherent drunkard when his 
                    frontal lobe was pierced by a railway beam (Guy-Evans 3). If 
                    it is true that our behaviors stem from our brain and its 
                    development, then it is also true that the neurons that lead 
                    to a functioning brain directly control our behavior. These 
                    neurons are comprised of atomic and subatomic particles, which 
                    obey Newtonian laws, meaning that our behaviors are due to 
                    external forces outside of our control.
